# Convert the OPML-file from Overcast to Markdown and HTML

Make sure `overcast.opml` is in this directory and `markdown` is installed from `pip`. Then just run `python main.py`.

## TODO

* Verify sane XML.
* Assertions that the files actually exist and fail gracefully.
* Full instructions on how to install and run.
